1 Java basics
  1.1 The structure of a Java application:
    project
    ..packageA
    ....java fileA
    ......public class fileA
    ......private class anyClassName
    ......pricate class anyClassName2
    ....java fileB
    ......public class fileB
    ......private class anyClassName
    ......private class anyClassName2
    ..packageB
    ....java fileC
    ....java fileD
    
  1.2 The structure of a Java class
    >> components of a Java class
      a) package statements
      b) import statements
      c) class declarations(a file can contain only 1 public class)
      d) comments(// and /**/, reference to java-code-conventions)
      e) Class variables(static first, public->procted->package->private
      f) methods(groupbed by functionalities)
    >> the package statements
      a) package represents the structure of the project directories, indicatingthat where is the current .java file put
         All java classes are port of a package. A java class can be explicitly
defined in a named package; otherwise it becomes part of a default package, whi
ch does not have a name.
        A package statement is used to explicitly define which package a class
is in. If a class includes a package statement, it must be the first statement
in the class definitioni(not the first line, the first line usually is a comm
ent)
        If there is a package statement, it must appear exactly only once in a 
class file.
      b) e.g.if there is this package statemetns:
         package com.kaizhousoft.MyPackage
         that means the current .java file(containing this statement) is placed
         at /com/kaizhousoft/MyPackage directory
      c) and to executing the class file:
         --> $ java com.kaizhousoft.MyPackage.ClassName, without .class suffix
    >> the signature of the main method as the entrance of the executable:
      a) public static void main (String [] args) 
      b) make use of the args as arguments when executing the application
      c) a sample execute of java application with args:
         --> $ java MyApp Zhou Kai
         the above sample passes two strings, Zhou and Kai as args, notice that
         we don't need double quotes
    >> the import statements
      a) understand packages
      b) the import statements:
         import java.lang.*;
    >> access modifiers
      public : can be accessed through inner class and outside class and sub-class
      protected : can be accessed through inner class and sub-classes
      default(package) : can be accessed through files within the same directory
      private : can only be accessed within the class itself
    >> Use abstract classes and interfaces
    >> Apply the static keyword to methods and fields
